# Minimal Snake Game Using Python and Turtle

This Python project is a minimalistic Snake Game designed for simplicity and entertainment. The game features a classic snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with its own body and the screen edges.

## Features
- **Snake Movement:** Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
- **Food Generation:** Randomly generated food appears on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the score as the snake consumes food and grows longer.
- **Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the screen edges.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Game:** Execute the main Python script using an IDE or the command line.
3. **Play the Game:** Control the snake using arrow keys and aim to achieve the highest score possible.

## Code Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `snake.py`: Main game logic, including the game loop, screen setup, and event handling.
- `snake_gui.py`: GUI-related functions, such as setting up the screen and updating the display.
- `snake_objects.py`: Turtle objects and score-related functions, defining the snake, food, and score display.
- `snake_controls.py`: Control-related functions, handling user input to control the snake's movement.

Explore the code to understand how Python and Turtle graphics are utilized to create a simple and enjoyable Snake Game.

Feel free to contribute and provide feedback to enhance the game further!
